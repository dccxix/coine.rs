# Contributing to Coine.rs

Thank you for considering contributing to Coine.rs! Since Coine.rs is an open wiki, the contributing process is easy.

Every page hosted on the Coine.rs website is available in this repository (https://github.com/dccxix/coine.rs). Coine.rs engine uses Markdown Extra. You can read about Markdown Extra [basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) and [syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). There's also a useful cheat sheet on Markdown [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

All pages are stored in the `Pages` directory. While creating a new page you may use any existing one as an example (use `Raw` button to see its source code).

If you want to add a new page or edit an existing one you have three ways to do so:

* Just fork the repository, add or edit some files, and make a pull request;
* Create (https://github.com/dccxix/coine.rs/new/master/Pages) and edit (using the pencil button) files by using the GitHub interface.
* If you're not familiar with the GitHub interface, you can always just send your article to info@coine.rs and our editor will publish it.

Here are some **tips**:

1. File names may contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, periods and hyphens. File extension should be `.md`. Examples: if the article is about John Doe, name the file `John_Doe.md`, if the article is about ACME Inc., use `ACME.md`;
2. The first heading in the text will be used as the page title;
3. The first table in the text will be converted to an infobox;
4. When using links, use full file names (e.g. `John_Doe.md`, but not `John_Doe`);
5. You can add snippets to a page using `{Snippet:Snippet_File_Name.md}`. Snippets are stored in the `Pages/Snippets` folder. You can create new snippets or edit the existing ones as well as articles;
6. Upload images using [our image uploader](https://coine.rs/Image). The other way is to put images to the `Pages/Images` folder using Git.
7. Since it's Git, the edit history of every page is always available;
8. Try to insert as many references and proof links as possible - the main goal of the wiki is to be objective;
9. After you make a pull request, wait for a while, it will soon get merged, and your changes will appear on the site. 

Our **principles**:

1. We do not publish sensitive private information like phone numbers, home addresses, IP addresses, SSN, and so on.
2. We stay neutral on controversial topics. Our aim is to cover various developers' opinions on the issues, but not to have a personal opinion neither on the issues nor the developers themselves.
3. We publish articles only about prominent developers and projects in the cryptocurrency field.
